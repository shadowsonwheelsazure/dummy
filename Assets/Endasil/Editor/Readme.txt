Small editor extension to make it easier to clean 
up files that are to be sent to altspace by helping 
you find any game objects with scrips or missing 
components on them in the scene.

Usage:

After importing the asset you will find a new 
'Find scripts in scene' choice under the Tools
menu at the top of the unity window. When you 
select this a new window will pop up listing all
game objects with scrips or missing components 
in the current scene. Click on any item in the list 
to select it in the hierarchy.
